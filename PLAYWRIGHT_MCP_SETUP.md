# Playwright MCP Integration for CareSync

## Overview
This setup allows Claude Code to see and interact with your React Native Expo web app in real-time using Playwright MCP server.

## What's Been Configured

### 1. Playwright MCP Server
- âœ… Installed globally: `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`
- âœ… Added to Claude Code MCP configuration
- âœ… Can be accessed through Claude Code commands

### 2. Playwright Testing Framework
- âœ… Installed `@playwright/test` and `playwright`
- âœ… Created `playwright.config.js` with proper configuration
- âœ… Set up test directory structure in `tests/playwright/`
- âœ… Created example test files

### 3. React Native Components
- âœ… Added `testID` props to navigation tabs
- âœ… Added `testID` to dashboard container and main components
- âœ… Components will render as `data-testid` attributes in web build

### 4. Test Integration
- âœ… Created `PlaywrightTestAgent.js` for automated testing
- âœ… Integrated with existing `MasterTestRunner.js`
- âœ… Added new npm scripts for Playwright testing

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Start with Script
```bash
# Run the startup script
./scripts/start-with-playwright.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Expo web on port 8081
npm run web:test

# Terminal 2: In Claude Code, use MCP commands
# (Available automatically through MCP integration)
```

## Available Claude Code MCP Commands

Once your app is running, you can use these commands in Claude Code:

```
Use playwright mcp to open a browser to http://localhost:8081
Use playwright mcp to take a screenshot of the current page
Use playwright mcp to click on [data-testid="tab-calendar"]
Use playwright mcp to fill [data-testid="input-field"] with "test data"
Use playwright mcp to wait for [data-testid="dashboard-container"] to be visible
```

## NPM Scripts Added

```json
{
  "web:test": "expo start --web --port 8081",
  "test:playwright": "node src/testing/MasterTestRunner.js --suite=playwright",
  "playwright:test": "playwright test",
  "playwright:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "playwright:debug": "playwright test --debug"
}
```

## Test IDs Available

- `data-testid="dashboard-container"` - Main dashboard
- `data-testid="tab-home"` - Home navigation tab
- `data-testid="tab-calendar"` - Calendar navigation tab
- `data-testid="tab-log"` - Log navigation tab
- `data-testid="tab-insights"` - Insights navigation tab
- `data-testid="tab-settings"` - Settings navigation tab

   ```

3. **Take a screenshot:**
   ```
   Use playwright mcp to take a screenshot of the current page
   ```

4. **Interact with the app:**
   ```
   Use playwright mcp to click on [data-testid="tab-calendar"]
   Use playwright mcp to click on [data-testid="log-period-button"]
   ```

5. **Run automated tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:playwright
   ```

## Benefits

- **Real-time UI/UX feedback** - Claude can see your app as you build it
- **Automated testing** - Comprehensive UI tests run through Playwright
- **Cross-browser testing** - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile viewports
- **Visual regression testing** - Detect unintended UI changes
- **Accessibility testing** - Ensure your app is accessible to all users

## Next Steps

1. Start your app with `./scripts/start-with-playwright.sh`
2. In Claude Code, use the MCP commands to interact with your app
3. Make changes to your components and see them reflected immediately
4. Use automated tests to ensure quality
